## What is Office 2010 Toolkit and EZ-Activator 2.0 Beta 4?

The tool combines both EZ Activator and KMS Auto modules, which are two different methods of activating Office 2010. EZ Activator is a simple one-click method that uses a technique called emulated KMS server. It creates a virtual server on your computer that mimics the genuine KMS server of Microsoft and tricks Office into thinking that it is activated by a valid license.
 
KMS Auto is a more advanced method that uses a real KMS server that is hosted online by the hackers. It connects your computer to the server and activates Office using a genuine KMS key. This method requires an internet connection and may not work if the server is down or blocked by your firewall or antivirus.
